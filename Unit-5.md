# 📘 MCSE-204 – UNIT 5: Project Monitoring & Control Techniques

---

## 🔶 🔥 Q1. PLANNING–MONITORING–CONTROLLING CYCLE

✅ **Easy Definition**: This cycle is used in project management to ensure that the project stays on track from beginning to end through continuous planning, monitoring progress, and controlling deviations.

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**: Like using Google Maps — you plan your route, monitor your journey, and adjust if there's traffic.

📌 **Phases**:

1. **Planning**:

   * Define tasks and timeline
   * Allocate resources
   * Estimate cost
2. **Monitoring**:

   * Track actual vs planned progress
   * Identify delays or issues
3. **Controlling**:

   * Take corrective actions
   * Reallocate resources or re-schedule

📌 **Benefits**:

* Keeps project aligned with goals
* Reduces risks and surprises
* Improves resource usage

📌 **Summary**:

* Cycle runs continuously
* Makes project management adaptive

## 🔶 🔥 Q2. TYPES OF PROJECT CONTROL

✅ **Easy Definition**: Project control types are the various methods used to monitor and adjust different aspects of a project.

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**: Like managing different knobs in a sound studio — volume, bass, treble — each controls a part of the output.

📌 **Types**:

1. **Schedule Control**:

   * Ensures timeline is met
   * Uses tools like Gantt Charts, CPM
2. **Cost Control**:

   * Tracks budget usage
   * Uses Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
3. **Quality Control**:

   * Ensures standards are met
   * Uses testing, reviews
4. **Scope Control**:

   * Manages project boundaries
   * Prevents scope creep
5. **Risk Control**:

   * Identifies and mitigates risks

📌 **Summary**:

* Each control focuses on a specific project dimension
* Helps maintain balance in performance, cost, and time

## 🔶 🔥 Q3. PURPOSES OF PROJECT CONTROL

✅ **Easy Definition**: Project control is done to detect issues early, correct problems quickly, and ensure project objectives are met.

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**: Like regularly checking your bank balance to avoid overspending.

📌 **Main Purposes**:

* Detect deviations from plan
* Take corrective actions
* Communicate status to stakeholders
* Support decision-making
* Improve future planning

📌 **Benefits**:

* Ensures transparency
* Improves accountability
* Saves time and money

📌 **Summary**:

* Control is necessary to guide the project
* Without control, plans can easily fail

---

📝 **Quick Recap:**

* Planning–Monitoring–Controlling = Continuous cycle for success
* Types of Control = Schedule, Cost, Quality, Scope, Risk
* Purpose = Identify, correct, and prevent problems

📌 Use tools like:

* Gantt Chart
* CPM/PERT
* Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
* Risk Register
* Issue Logs
