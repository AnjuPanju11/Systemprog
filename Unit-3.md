# 📘 MCSE-204 – UNIT 3: Memory Allocation, Optimization & Data Flow Analysis

---

## 🔶 🔥 Q1. TECHNIQUES OF DYNAMIC STORAGE ALLOCATION

✅ **Easy Definition**: Dynamic storage allocation is the process of assigning memory at runtime depending on the program’s requirements.

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**: Like booking a hotel room after arriving in the city, instead of reserving it before.

📌 **Techniques**:

* **First Fit**: Allocates the first free block that’s large enough
* **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest suitable free block
* **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available free block

📌 **Comparison**:

* First Fit: Fast but may leave small gaps
* Best Fit: Less space wastage, but slower
* Worst Fit: Leaves large holes, not efficient

📌 **Summary**:

* Allocates memory during execution
* Can cause fragmentation if not managed
* Helps in flexible and optimized memory use

## 🔶 🔥 Q2. UNIFIED ALGORITHM FOR DATA FLOW ANALYSIS

✅ **Easy Definition**: A single generalized algorithm used to solve various data flow problems (like reaching definitions, live variables, etc.).

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**: Like a single Swiss army knife for multiple repair jobs.

📌 **Steps**:

1. Initialize IN\[B] and OUT\[B] for each basic block B
2. Repeat until stable (no change in values):

   * IN\[B] = Union of OUT of predecessors
   * OUT\[B] = (IN\[B] – Kill\[B]) ∪ Gen\[B]

📌 **Used For**:

* Live variable analysis
* Available expressions
* Constant propagation

📌 **Summary**:

* One approach for many problems
* Works on control flow graphs
* Used heavily in compiler optimization

## 🔶 🔥 Q3. CONCURRENTISATION AND VECTORIZATION

✅ **Easy Definition**:

* **Concurrentisation**: Dividing program parts to run in parallel.
* **Vectorisation**: Converting operations on single values into operations on arrays or vectors.

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**:

* Concurrentisation: Multiple chefs cooking separate dishes
* Vectorisation: One chef preparing many sandwiches at once

📌 **Concurrentisation**:

* Improves performance on multi-core systems
* Requires analyzing data dependencies

📌 **Vectorisation**:

* Uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)
* Boosts performance in loops and math operations

📌 **Summary**:

* Increases speed and efficiency
* Common in scientific computing, AI, and HPC

## 🔶 🔥 Q4. LOOP-CARRIED VS LOOP-INDEPENDENT DEPENDENCIES

✅ **Easy Definition**:

* **Loop-Carried**: Current iteration depends on previous one
* **Loop-Independent**: Each iteration is independent

🌍 **Real-world Analogy**:

* Loop-Carried: You can’t fill the next bucket until the first is done
* Loop-Independent: You can fill all buckets at once using multiple taps

📌 **Examples**:

* **Loop-Carried**: `A[i] = A[i-1] + 1`
* **Loop-Independent**: `A[i] = B[i] + C[i]`

📌 **Importance**:

* Helps compilers decide if loops can be parallelized

📌 **Summary**:

* Loop-Carried = Serial execution
* Loop-Independent = Safe for parallel execution

---

📝 **Quick Recap:**

* Dynamic Allocation = Runtime memory assignment
* Unified Algorithm = Generic data flow model
* Concurrentisation = Task parallelism
* Vectorisation = Data parallelism
* Loop-Carried vs Independent = Key for optimization
